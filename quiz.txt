- What is the difference between ***var*** and ***let***?

Both can be reassigned, but var can be redeclared while let cannot. They also have a different scope--let is block scoped, while var is added to the window object (global scope) or scoped to the function that contains it. 

- What is the difference between **var** and ***const***?

The differences between var and const are essentially the same as between let and const, however const cannot be redeclared or reassigned, while var can do both. 

- What is the difference between **let** and **const**?

let and const are both block scoped variablles, however while let can be reassigned, const cannot.

var variables are run prior to initialization, as if they have been moved to the top of the document (or "hoisted" up).
